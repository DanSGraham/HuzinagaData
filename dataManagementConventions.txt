A directory heirarchy will be used to store and manage data. The goal is to balance breadth and depth of directories to keep them in balance.
Directories with data files will have an accompanying DOC.txt to give info about the files in general and the naming convention.

Scripts will be stored in the scripts directory in the main directory

Custom code will be stored in the code directory in the main directory

Directories with data that is currently being studied or examined will be named as follows:
YYYYMM_projectName
All directories will start with the year and month they were created.
After initial naming of project directory, subsequent directories should follow a naming scheme documented in the DOC.txt within the project directory.

Files will be named to aid in search and ease of viewing.
Files will be named by the following convention:
YYYYMMDD_projectname...
Following the same convention as for directories where the additional info is specified in the DOC.txt of the file directory.

Files which are temporary will end with _temp.[suffix] and may be deleted at the end of a session. These will be stored in a /temp directory when working.

Directories with data that is no longer active, but should be stored will be moved to the archive directory.
Directories moved to the archive directory will be modified as follows.

If data collection is finished and complete directory will begin with fin_


If data collection is incomplete and unfinished directory will begin with unfin_  and an accompanying text file will be present in the directory titled README.txt


Git will be used for maintaining version control of programs.
